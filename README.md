# Build intuitive, powerful wireframes for smarter web development

Wirefy was created as a tool to help web designers and developers create fast, manageable wireframes. It helps to speed up the journey between sketches and final deliverables. Like the web, it is in constant iteration. This requires a simple workflow and a well-defined collection of [atomic elements](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) so that new UIs can be quickly pulled together.

It is our belief that we aren't building pages but rather systems of components. This is why Wirefy has been built to be as flexible and comprehensive as it possible can be.  We are giving you the foundation layer to build on. You can style, add or remove components as you see fit. 

Our goal is to help you make smarter UX decisions by focusing on the content first rather than the subjective design decisions. With a bit of base knowledge of HTML and CSS, you can start building flexible wireframes without the headache of working through countless calculations.

Creating static wireframes can be great but sometimes clients just don't understand how they function or change based on various devices. Building functional wireframes will help you communicate with clients better and work as a foundation for your fluid designs without losing sight of the importance of the content.
